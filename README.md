# Linked List Implementation

This project contains the implementation of a linked list in C.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c linked_list.c -o linkedlist
```

## Usage

After compiling, you can run the program using:

```bash
./linkedlist
```

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and program logic.
- `linked_list.c`: Contains the implementation of linked list operations.
- `linked_list.h`: Header file for the linked list.

## Features

- Add nodes to the linked list.
- Delete nodes from the linked list.
- Traverse and display the linked list.

## Prerequisites

- GCC compiler installed on your system.

## Notes

Ensure that all files (`main.c`, `linked_list.c`, and `linked_list.h`) are in the same directory before compiling.
